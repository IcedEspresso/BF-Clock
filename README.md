Meant for private servers, this is made to track spawn timers based on server start inputted by the user. When something spawns, the status of that will be marked as active and a notification noise will play.

TODO:

- Better validation method, currently the alert can break the input field momentarily.
- Better input fields, alongside the above.
- Improved settings menu.
